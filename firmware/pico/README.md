# Pico firmware for can crusher project.

Assuming you've set up a Pico development environment as described in
[Getting Started with
Pico](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/pico/getting-started-with-pico.pdf):

Then build the project standard CMake style:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

And you will have a UF2 file ready for installation.
